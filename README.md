# Aramesh-DeplyReady
Aramesh organization is a Family Therapy clinic. The board wanted to turn a family assessment test that they had developed into a full-ﬂedged web app. This project needed eﬃcient approach and clarity in design for the therapists and practitioners to be able to employ the information derived from the test results in their practices and studies.


• We developed a fully interactive chart package using canvas API.


• We used inertia.js to write single-page applications (SPA) using classic server-side routing and controllers.


Technologies used in this project: Laravel, Inertia, React, Canvas API, Nginx, Postgresql


## Files Structure
The files are split into two folders. The server provided by the client was configured with Direct Admin and this file structure was used so we could easily work with direct admin.
